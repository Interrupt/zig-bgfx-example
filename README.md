# Zig + BGFX Example Project
A small example project that shows how to use BGFX from Zig, based on Ziggy (https://github.com/heretique/ziggy)

## Running
- Compile shaders first with `zig build shaders`
- Then `zig build run`

## Notes
- Building will build BGFX's shader compiler called `shaderc` alongside the app.
